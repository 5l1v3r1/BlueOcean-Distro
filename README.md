# BlueOcean-Distro
A small custom gnome OS I setup. :)
This OS can be run on both VirtualBox and Vmware.
However though, it can't be setup as an iso (As there is no real efficient way of making a .vdi or .vmhdk file into an iso format)

Heres the download link:

# Look and Feel

The design wasn't much besides going for a "deep blue" type of feel. Similar to that of an ocean. Yes it has MacOS icons, but you can very easily change that to whatever you prefer.
